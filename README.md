## Sales Reporting System â€“ Advanced SQL Server Project
Overview
This project demonstrates advanced SQL Server querying and performance tuning techniques using a sales reporting system.
It is fully containerized using Docker and designed for portability, reproducibility, and professional showcasing of SQL expertise.

## Features
Advanced SQL queries using:

CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

Window Functions: RANK, LAG, DATEDIFF

PIVOT and CASE

GROUPING SETS

Recursive CTE

Performance Optimization:

Use of Indexes and Filtered Indexes

Analysis with Execution Plans

I/O and Time Statistics via SET STATISTICS

Containerized SQL Server via Docker Compose

Modular and clean project structure for easy navigation

 
## Quick Start

Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/mgolozar/sqlserver-docker-project.git
cd sqlserver-docker-project
Start SQL Server with Docker Compose

cd docker
docker-compose up -d
Connect using VSCode

Use SQL Server extension.

Server: localhost, Port: 1433, Login: sa, Password: YourStrong!Pass123

Run Scripts

Execute init.sql and sample_data.sql to prepare the database.

Explore and run queries/advanced_queries.sql.

## Sample Queries & Techniques
âœ… Customer Spending with RANK
Ranks customers by total amount spent using RANK() over total purchases.

âœ… Sales Category Classification
Categorizes products based on total units sold using CASE.

âœ… Multi-level Aggregation with GROUPING SETS
Provides flexible aggregation in a single query.

âœ… Purchase Behavior Analysis
Uses LAG() and DATEDIFF() to calculate time between customer purchases.

âœ… Recursive CTE for Order Hierarchy
Demonstrates hierarchical query patterns.

ðŸ“ˆ Performance Tuning Highlights
Created Index on OrderItems (OrderID, ProductID) to improve join speed.

Used Filtered Index for products with price > 1000.

Enabled SET STATISTICS IO/TIME for query tuning.

Sample Output (Execution Stats)
 
Logical Reads: 12
CPU Time: 5 ms
Elapsed Time: 7 ms
Execution Plan shows Index Seek (90%) instead of Table Scan.
